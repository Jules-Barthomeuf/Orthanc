## API Endpoints (Future)

Currently the app uses mock data. Future API structure:

POST   /api/auth/signup             # Register endpoint
GET    /api/properties              # List all properties

POST   /api/properties              # Create property
GET    /api/agents/:id              # Get agent profile
PUT    /api/agents/:id              # Update agent profile
```

## Security Notes

- Current implementation uses mock JWT for demo purposes
- In production: Update JWT_SECRET in .env
- In production: Implement proper password hashing and validation
- In production: Add HTTPS enforcement
- In production: Implement rate limiting and input validation

## Performance Considerations

- Images are optimized via Unsplash CDN (demo)
- Use Next.js Image component for production images
- Implement caching strategies for property data
- Consider CDN for static assets
- Database queries should be optimized with proper indexing
