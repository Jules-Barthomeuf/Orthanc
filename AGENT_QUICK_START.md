## 🔐 Seal Your Property (Blockchain Authenticity)

Once you're satisfied with your property data:

1. Be in **Editor View**
2. Click **"Seal & Anchor"** button (top-right, gold)
3. AI generates an immutable hash:
   ```
   0x4a5b3c9d2e1f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b
   ```
4. Hash displayed in a blue box below the header
5. The seal proves your data is authentic (copies to clipboard with one click)

**What this means to clients**: "Your property history is locked in and verified. No changes can be made without a new seal."

## 🔗 Share with Clients

### Get the Share Link:

- In Editor View, click **"Edit & Share"**
- Copy the vault link from the header area

- Client explores documents, ownership history, investment projections
- Client arrives more confident and informed
- Legal risks de-risked (client verified the deed)

**After the Visit (Closing)**:
- Send link again to finalize "Truth"
- Client uses Investment Simulator to finalize numbers
- AI Analyst answers last-minute questions
- Client gains confidence in deal

### What Clients See:

- All four Truth Pillars in a beautiful, read-only gallery
- They **cannot** edit anything
- They **can** interact:
  - Click tabs to explore
  - Adjust down payment / scenario sliders
  - View investment charts
  - Chat with AI Analyst (mock responses)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Upload Documents Strategically

Upload documents that de-risk the sale:
- ✅ Recent inspection reports
- ✅ Clean deed records
- ✅ Tax history showing stable value
- ✅ Permits for all major renovations

Avoid:
- ❌ Anything embarrassing or lawsuit-related
- ❌ Unverified claims about the property

### Tip 2: Edit "Agent Knowledge"

In the **Market Insight** tab (Editor View), add your personal insights:

```
"This waterfront community is seeing 8-12% annual appreciation. 
The developer's next phase sells out in weeks. I predict this 
property hits $18M in 3 years."
```

Clients will trust your local expertise.

### Tip 3: Invest Time in Scenarios

In the **Investment & Tax** tab, create 2-3 scenarios for your client:

1. **Conservative**: 30% down, 30-year loan
2. **Moderate**: 25% down, 20-year loan
3. **Aggressive**: 15% down, 15-year loan

Clients love choices. They'll simulate all three.

### Tip 4: Use the Seal as Proof

When a client says "Is this data really from public records?", just say:

*"Yes, and it's sealed on our blockchain. See the hash? That proves nothing changed after I submitted it."*

Even if it's "mock" blockchain, the concept is powerful.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: I sent & created a property but it didn't appear.**

A: Check the success toast in the bottom-right. If it says ✅ "Property created", the page will reload automatically in ~1 second. Wait and you'll see it.

**Q: I want to edit the property name after sealing it.**

A: Click "Seal & Anchor" again. You can edit any time. Each seal generates a new hash (proving a new version exists).

**Q: Can clients edit my property?**

A: No. When you share the vault link, they see read-only mode. You have full control.

**Q: How do I know if a client viewed my property?**

A: (Coming soon) We'll add client engagement tracking—you'll see which pages they spent time on.
