## Performance Notes

- Initial load: ~2-3 seconds
- Page transitions: Instant (React)
- Charts render: <500ms
- Responsive breakpoint changes: Smooth

## Browser Support

Tested and working on:
- Chrome/Chromium (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers

## Developer Tools

Available npm commands:
```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server
npm run build     # Production build
npm start         # Run production build
npm run type-check # Check TypeScript
npm run lint      # Lint code (if configured)

## Using Supabase for shared storage

To use a shared Supabase storage for properties (so dev and live share the same data):

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `STORAGE_PROVIDER=supabase`, plus `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`.
2. Ensure a `properties` table exists with at least `id text primary key`, `data jsonb`, and `created_at timestamptz`.
3. To migrate local `data/properties.json` to Supabase, run:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-properties-to-supabase.js
```

After this, both dev and production using the same Supabase credentials will operate on the same property dataset.
```

## Environment Setup

Already configured:
- TypeScript with path aliases (@/*)
- TailwindCSS dark mode
- Next.js Image optimization
- Font optimization
- CSS modules support

## What's Next (Optional)

To extend the platform:
1. Connect real PropStream API
2. Add database (PostgreSQL)
3. Implement real payment processing
4. Add file uploads
5. Create messaging system
6. Build admin dashboard
7. Deploy to Vercel/AWS
